\section{Introduction}

Factorisation problem of a huge number resolved into massive parallel solutions. Large number of algorithms are currently state-of-art and are continuously developed into better forms. This short article is focused on implementation of Pollard-Rho algorithm on \texttt{CUDA} device. In first part there is a definition of algorithm. Next the article focuses on options of parallelism on CUDA device. Results are measured in multiple instances and compared in graphs. 

\section{Definition of the algorithm}


The $\rho$ algorithm (named after the shape of curves symbolising two functions trying to reach themselves in projective space) is based on finding cycle. In t random numbers of $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_t$ in range $[1, n]$ will contain repetition with probability of $P > 0.5$ if $t > 1.777n^{\frac{1}{2}}$
